        <h3>Encountering an Artifact</h3>

        <ol>
        <li class="questions">Look at the artifact, before opening. Take it in with all your senses. Think of it as an object of meditation. Explore the object from the perspective of an anthropologist, ethnographer, or historian.  What strikes you?  (Notice the size, shape, binding, illustrations, textures, images). Make note of your observations, including impressions or free associations with the object.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The object has maritime symbols on sides, latitude and longitude marks, and sea routes from Egypt. Scale is to English miles. There is a zoom in on the Dardanelles. It is oddly empty in Asia minor while other areas have mountains. The Nile Delta and Suez Canal are labelled in Egypt.</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="questions">Can you begin to say anything about its use, ideal audience, readership, aims of the printer, publisher, author, or artist? Can you begin to speculate about or imagine an original reader? Is the object gendered? Does it presume or project an age on the reader? A race? Or socio-economic class?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The map is in english and is made from fabric, so the audience is likey to be a middle-class collector, as it can't be for use at sea but wouldn't be the prized object of a millionaire either, probably.</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="questions">Open the object. Pay attention to the flyleaf. Do you notice any writings or inscriptions? Turn the pages carefully, noticing presence or absence of any paratext or front matter: title page, copyright page, table of contexts, index, dedications, frontispiece.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> The maps are from G. A. Chadburn, who also has a Egypt photograph album circa 1910s in the Yale library.</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="questions">Browse the volume as a whole. Note any images, marks, or written text within the volume.  What kinds of texts are juxtaposed next to one another (periodicals/journals/magazines).  Are there illustrations? What do you notice about them? Are there other marks/marginalia or other signs of use?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>There is a another map that accompanies the Dardanelles centered map that shows a map of almost all of Europe centered at Germany. This map and the original map both have the colors and pattern of the french flag. The flags shows Britain's ally status in the triple entente and with belgium. The French colors are the same as colors for the british flag, but the blue is either faded or oddly light, giving it more of a maritime theme than otherwise.</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="questions">Notice any back-matter paratextsâ€”advertisements, announcements, further inscriptions.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The middle of the map is Turkey yet Turkey not the main focus of the map. Instead there is much more detail on maritine routes and regions of interest for British imperialism.</li>
        </ul>
        <li class="questions">What do you need to know to further understand this artifact? For example, how was it made, who it belonged to , specific aspects of the cultural, social, historical situation from which it emerged. What would your next research steps be? How might you imagine the role of this object within a research project?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I need to know the identity of G. A. Chadburn and if this map was made before or after the outbreak of WWI. Nontheless the alienation of Turkey and Persia over the rest of the map is an interesting point to dive in on regardless of if GB is currently at war with them.</li>
        </ul>
        </ol>
